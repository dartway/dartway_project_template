# DartWay Dev Guidelines

This repository contains the **official development guidelines for DartWay projects**.

It serves two purposes:

1. **For developers** â€” guidelines are published on the DartWay documentation site as a knowledge base: how to structure projects, how to work with Flutter and Serverpod, what conventions and rules to follow.
2. **For AI-assisted development (Cursor)** â€” the same guidelines are used as `rules` inside the [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh). This ensures that when developers work with AI coding assistants, the AI follows the same standards and project conventions.

By keeping these rules in a single repository, we guarantee **full synchronization** between human-readable documentation and machine-readable rules.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
dev-guidelines/
- `foundations` â€” general architecture and development principles for DartWay projects.
- `flutter` â€” rules for Flutter codebases (UI, features, state, design tokens).
- `server` â€” rules for Serverpod backend (endpoints, DB, services).
---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. As documentation (Docusaurus)
This repo is included into the DartWay website as a subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix website/docs/dev-guidelines \
  https://github.com/dartway/dartway_guidelines main --squash
```


2. As Cursor rules

The same repo is used inside projects to provide AI coding guidance in Cursor IDE
.

Rules are added via subtree directly into .cursor/rules/ (and scoped to project parts):

```bash
# Foundations (global rules)
git subtree add --prefix .cursor/rules/dev-guidelines/foundations \
  https://github.com/dartway/dartway_guidelines main --squash

# Frontend (Flutter) rules
git subtree add --prefix frontend/.cursor/rules/dev-guidelines/frontend \
  https://github.com/dartway/dartway_guidelines main --squash

# Backend (Serverpod) rules
git subtree add --prefix backend/server/.cursor/rules/dev-guidelines/backend \
  https://github.com/dartway/dartway_guidelines main --squash

```

Update to the latest version:
```bash
git subtree pull --prefix .cursor/rules/dev-guidelines/foundations \
  https://github.com/dartway/dartway_guidelines main --squash
```

This ensures that when developers use AI to generate code, the AI follows the same standards that are written in documentation.

ðŸ’¡ Why this matters
Single source of truth â†’ no duplication between docs and Cursor.
Consistency â†’ both humans and AI follow the same standards.
Scalability â†’ easy to update rules once and roll them out across projects.
Transparency â†’ new developers can learn the rules from the website, while AI already enforces them inside IDE.

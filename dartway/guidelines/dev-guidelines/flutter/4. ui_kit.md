# UI Kit

:::warning
Currently DartWay UI Kit (`dartway_ui_kit`) is in development.  
Strict guidelines for creating a full UI Kit in a project will be added soon.  
Use the following rules as a temporary standard until the package is released.
:::

UI Kit is the **only allowed entry point** for design system elements in DartWay apps.  
It ensures all features use the same styles and components consistently.

---

## Core principles

1. **One import only**  
   - Import components only via the root `ui_kit.dart`.  
   - Never import specific buttons, colors, or styles directly.  

2. **All parts are declared in `ui_kit.dart`**  
   - Each component file must start with `part of 'ui_kit.dart';`.  
   - Root file `ui_kit.dart` collects and exports all components.  
   - Features import **only** `ui_kit.dart`, never individual files.  

3. **No raw styling in features**  
   Inside feature code (`/lib/feature_name`):  
   - Do not use `Color`, `TextStyle`, `BorderRadius`, or `context.textTheme / context.colorTheme`.  
   - Always use ready-made components from UI Kit.  

4. **Isolated visual layer**  
   - UI Kit must not depend on business logic or state.  
   - Components = pure visuals + minimal props.  

5. **Reusable, not feature-specific**  
   - UI Kit includes **common building blocks** only (buttons, inputs, cards, lists, modals).  
   - If something belongs to a specific feature â†’ keep it inside the feature.

## Extended colors and themes

DartWay uses **Extended Material Colors** with `ColorFamily`:  
- Supports multiple themes (light, dark, high contrast, etc.).  
- All colors are centralized and accessed via static properties.  

Example:

```dart
final primary = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary;
final danger = ExtendedColor.danger.primary;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Features must never access context themes directly.
Always use the static getters from the centralized theme.

File structure
```
lib/ui_kit/
  ui_kit.dart          // root, contains `part` directives
  buttons/
    primary_button.dart
    secondary_button.dart
  inputs/
    text_field.dart
  surfaces/
    card.dart
  theme/
    material_theme.dart
    extended_color.dart
```

Example ui_kit.dart:

```dart

part 'buttons/primary_button.dart';
part 'buttons/secondary_button.dart';
part 'inputs/text_field.dart';
part 'surfaces/card.dart';
part 'theme/material_theme.dart';
part 'theme/extended_color.dart';
```
Best practices
 - Keep props minimal and semantically meaningful (isPrimary, isDanger).
 - Avoid duplicating variants â€” use composition and extensions.
 - Always prefer consistency over visual hacks.

Why it matters
 - Consistency â†’ all features look the same.
 - Maintainability â†’ easy theme updates.
 - AI-friendly â†’ assistants wonâ€™t spread random colors or styles in features.
 - Scalable â†’ supports multiple themes without breaking features.

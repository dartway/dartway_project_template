# Flutter Project Structure

This document is the **entry point into the Flutter Guide**.  
It defines how to organize a DartWay Flutter application and connects to more detailed guides:
- [Feature Architecture](./feature_architecture)
- [UI Kit](./ui_kit)
- [Navigation](./navigation)
- (upcoming) State & Providers

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles

- **Feature-based** â†’ everything is split into small, isolated features.  
- **Minimal boilerplate** â†’ no abstractions just for the sake of architecture.  
- **Generic data layer** â†’ no repositories, no manual sync, everything goes through DartWay data layer.  
- **AI-friendly** â†’ the structure is optimized for assistants (Cursor, ChatGPT).

## ðŸ“‚ Recommended Project Layout

```yaml
lib/
â”œâ”€ admin/       # Features for admin panel
â”œâ”€ app/         # Main application features
â”‚ â”œâ”€ home/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ home_page/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€ promotion_block/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€ ...
â”‚ â”œâ”€ profile/
â”‚ â””â”€ ...
â”œâ”€ auth/        # Authentication (login, signup, tokens)
â”œâ”€ common/      # Shared utilities, configs, navigation
â”œâ”€ core/        # Global configuration (router, providers, services)
â”œâ”€ domain/      # Business logic on top of models (shared, cross-feature)
â”œâ”€ ui_kit/      # Unified entry point for design system
â”‚   â””â”€ ui_kit.dart
â”œâ”€ build_info.dart # build configuration vars (generated automatically)
â””â”€ main.dart    # App entry point
```

ðŸ‘‰ For large apps, you may create multiple `app_*` modules (e.g. `/app_orders`, `/app_chat`) â€” the same rules apply.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

Every feature is a small, self-contained folder with:
- **Entry Point** â†’ exactly one public file (page, widget, or context extension).  
- **Widgets** â†’ UI parts for layout and interactions.  
- **Logic** â†’ local providers, enums, helpers (scoped to this feature).  
- **Domain Extensions** â†’ cross-feature business logic belongs in `/domain`, never inside features.  
- **UI Kit** â†’ all styling and reusable visuals come only from `ui_kit.dart`.  

ðŸ‘‰ For details and examples, see [Feature Architecture](./feature_architecture).

---

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Kit

- UI Kit is the **only allowed source of styles**.  
- Inside `app/`, `auth/`, `common/` you must **not use directly**:  
  `Color`, `TextStyle`, `BorderRadius`, `context.textTheme`, `context.colorScheme`.  
- All features import only `ui_kit.dart`.  

ðŸ‘‰ See [UI Kit Guide](./ui_kit).

---

## ðŸ§­ Navigation

- Routes are defined with `NavigationZoneRoute` enums.  
- Use context extensions (`context.goTo`, `context.pushTo`).  
- Redirects and guards are configured centrally in router.  

ðŸ‘‰ See [Navigation Guide](./navigation).

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests

- Every feature must include tests:
  - **Widget tests** for pages and components.  
  - **Provider tests** for logic.  
- Place them in `/test/feature_name/...`.  

Tests ensure stability and make AI-generated code safer to adopt.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling the Project

- Keep features small. If a widget grows into a mini-flow, extract it as its own feature.  
- For large domains, split into `app_*` modules while keeping the same folder rules.  
- Domain logic must always remain in `/domain`, never spread across features.  
- All visuals remain in `/ui_kit`, ensuring consistent design.  

---

## âœ… Key Takeaways

- Start from this structure in every DartWay Flutter project.  
- Features are the building blocks â€” each with one public entry point.  
- Styling = UI Kit, business logic = Domain, navigation = Router.  
- Tests are mandatory.  
- Follow this consistently â†’ predictable, maintainable, AI-friendly apps.
